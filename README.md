# Age-Detection-System
A real-time Age Estimation System built using MediaPipe and OpenCV Deep Learning (Caffe). This project predicts the approximate age of a person in real time from a webcam feed or an uploaded image. It features a modern Tkinter GUI, and a smooth averaging system for stable age prediction across frames.
